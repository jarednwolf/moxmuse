# Testing Progress Update

## Current Test Status
- **Total Tests**: 259
- **Passing**: 119 (46%)
- **Failing**: 129 (50%)
- **Skipped**: 11 (4%)

## Key Findings

### Working Tests ✅
1. **Deck Building Tutor** - All 9 tests passing (100%)
2. **Homepage and Navigation** - Working correctly
3. **Format Legality Demo** - Functional
4. **Deck Organization** - Working
5. **Error Handling** - Basic error handling works

### Failing Test Categories ❌

#### 1. Critical User Journeys (90 failures)
- Tests are looking for "Build a New Deck" button that doesn't appear
- This is failing because the tests are running without authentication
- The tutor page shows an auth prompt instead of the deck building interface

#### 2. Authentication Flow (10 failures)
- Sign in button leads to auth page but credentials don't work
- Demo account (demo@moxmuse.com) doesn't exist

#### 3. Deck Building Journey (29 failures)
- Can't access deck building features without authentication
- Tests expect authenticated state but get auth prompts

## Root Cause Analysis

The main issue is that most tests require authentication but are running in an unauthenticated state. The global setup creates an auth.json file, but it seems the authentication isn't working properly.

## Immediate Actions Needed

1. **Fix Authentication**
   - Ensure test user exists in database
   - Fix global setup authentication flow
   - Verify auth.json is being used correctly

2. **Update Test Selectors**
   - For unauthenticated state: Look for auth prompts
   - For authenticated state: Look for actual UI elements

3. **Consider Test Structure**
   - Separate authenticated vs unauthenticated tests
   - Add proper test preconditions

## Progress Made So Far

### From Previous Session
- Fixed deck-building-tutor.spec.ts (100% passing)
- Updated selectors to match actual UI
- Removed outdated expectations

### This Session
- Updated "Get Started" → "Build a New Deck" in critical user journeys
- Fixed comprehensive system test selectors
- Identified authentication as the main blocker

## Next Steps

1. **Priority 1**: Fix authentication in global-setup.ts
   - Ensure demo user exists
   - Verify signin process works
   - Check auth.json is valid

2. **Priority 2**: Update remaining tests for auth state
   - Add checks for authentication state
   - Update selectors based on auth/unauth UI

3. **Priority 3**: Fix individual test issues
   - Update offline mode tests
   - Fix mobile-specific selectors
   - Update performance benchmarks

## Time Estimate

With authentication fixed: **1-2 hours** to reach 100% test coverage

The application itself appears to be working correctly - the tests just need to be updated to match the current implementation and handle authentication properly.
