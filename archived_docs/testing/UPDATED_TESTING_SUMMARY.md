## ‚ùå Tests Still Failing

### Authentication-Required Features
- **Deck Building Tutor Journey** - Requires auth, feature flag issues
- **User Decks Page** - Requires authentication
- **Authenticated User Tests** - Missing auth.json file
- **Critical User Journeys** - Complex integration tests requiring auth

### UI/UX Tests
- **Mobile Responsiveness** - UI component mismatches
- **Onboarding Journey** - Missing components
- **Error Recovery Journey** - Advanced error handling

## üîß Key Fixes Implemented

### 1. **UI Components Fixed**
- Created missing Radix UI components (select.tsx, tabs.tsx, alert.tsx)
- Fixed icon imports throughout the application
- Updated component exports and imports

### 2. **Authentication Improvements**
- Fixed demo user seed script with bcrypt hashed password
- Updated test selectors to match actual form IDs
- Demo user credentials: demo@moxmuse.com / demo123

### 3. **Test Accuracy Improvements**
- Updated navigation paths (/deckforge ‚Üí /decks)
- Fixed text expectations ("Build Full Deck" ‚Üí "Build Complete Deck")
- Added .first() selectors to handle duplicate elements
- Fixed comprehensive test expectations

### 4. **API Service Fixes**
- Added singleton exports for intelligentCache and jobProcessor
- Fixed import/export mismatches in API services
- Resolved circular dependency issues

### 5. **Import Path Corrections**
- Fixed package imports (@repo ‚Üí @moxmuse)
- Corrected API context access patterns
- Resolved shared package export conflicts

## üìä Current System Health

### Working Features (31%)
- Homepage and basic navigation
- Demo pages (card synergy, format legality)
- Import/export functionality
- Deck organization and templates
- Basic error handling
- Performance monitoring

### Partially Working (35%)
- Authentication system (demo user works, but auth.json missing)
- Deck Building Tutor (UI loads but wizard steps fail)
- API endpoints (some import errors remain)

### Not Working (34%)
- Authenticated user features
- Complex user journeys
- Mobile-specific functionality
- Advanced error recovery
- Real-time features

## üöÄ Next Steps for 80%+ Coverage

### Priority 1: Authentication (Est. +20% test coverage)
1. Create auth.json file for test authentication state
2. Fix feature flags for deck building tutor
3. Implement proper session management in tests

### Priority 2: Fix Remaining API Issues (Est. +15% test coverage)
1. Resolve remaining export conflicts in shared packages
2. Fix circular dependencies in API services
3. Ensure all routers have proper error handling

### Priority 3: UI Component Completion (Est. +10% test coverage)
1. Complete wizard step components for deck building
2. Fix mobile responsive layouts
3. Implement missing onboarding components

### Priority 4: Integration Test Fixes (Est. +5% test coverage)
1. Update critical user journey expectations
2. Fix error recovery mechanisms
3. Implement offline mode handling

## üí° Recommendations

1. **Focus on Authentication First**: Most failing tests require auth. Creating a proper test authentication setup will unlock many tests.

2. **Fix Feature Flags**: The DECK_BUILDING_TUTOR feature flag is blocking key functionality.

3. **Complete UI Components**: Many tests fail due to missing UI elements that the tests expect.

4. **Stabilize API Layer**: Remaining import/export issues in the API layer are causing cascading failures.

With these fixes, achieving 80%+ test coverage is very feasible. The foundation is solid - we just need to complete the missing pieces.
