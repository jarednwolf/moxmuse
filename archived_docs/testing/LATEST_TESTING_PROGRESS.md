- ✅ Fixed circular dependency issues
- ✅ Resolved duplicate export warnings

### 🚧 Remaining Issues to Fix

#### 1. Type Mismatches (High Priority)
- ❌ CommanderRecommendation type missing manaCost and strategy properties
- ❌ CardSynergyAnalysis component type mismatches
- ❌ RelatedCard type incompatibilities

#### 2. Authentication Persistence (Critical)
- ❌ Auth state not persisting between test runs
- ❌ Global setup authentication not working properly
- ❌ Tests requiring auth are failing

#### 3. API/Backend Issues
- ❌ tutor.generateFullDeck endpoint not implemented
- ❌ tutor.getCommanderSuggestions endpoint missing
- ❌ deck.create mutation failures

#### 4. Missing UI Components
- ❌ Wizard step components for deck building flow
- ❌ Progress indicators
- ❌ Loading states for async operations

#### 5. Feature Flags
- ❌ Deck building tutor feature may be gated
- ❌ Some demo pages not accessible

### 📈 Path to 100% Coverage

1. **Fix Type Issues** (Est. 2 hours)
   - Update shared types to match component expectations
   - Fix CardSynergyAnalysis type mismatches
   - Add missing properties to CommanderRecommendation

2. **Fix Authentication** (Est. 3-4 hours)
   - Debug global-setup.ts auth flow
   - Ensure auth.json is properly saved and loaded
   - Fix session persistence issues

3. **Implement Missing API Endpoints** (Est. 4-5 hours)
   - Create tutor.generateFullDeck handler
   - Create tutor.getCommanderSuggestions handler
   - Fix deck.create mutation

4. **Complete UI Components** (Est. 2-3 hours)
   - Implement missing wizard components
   - Add proper loading states
   - Fix progress indicators

5. **Enable Feature Flags** (Est. 1 hour)
   - Configure test environment for all features
   - Remove feature gates for testing

### 🎯 Next Steps

1. Fix type issues in CommanderSelectionGrid
2. Debug authentication persistence
3. Run tests again to see improved pass rate
4. Address remaining failures systematically

### 💡 Recommendations

- Focus on authentication first - it's blocking many tests
- Type issues are quick wins that will fix multiple components
- Consider mocking API endpoints if backend isn't ready
- Add retry logic for flaky tests
