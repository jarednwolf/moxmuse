  - Background sync for offline changes
  - Placeholder images for offline card viewing
  - IndexedDB storage for offline actions

## ðŸ”§ Technical Implementation Details

### Haptic Feedback System
- Integrated throughout all touch interactions
- Different vibration patterns for different actions:
  - Light tap: 10ms
  - Success: [50, 50, 50]ms
  - Error: [100, 50, 100]ms
  - Long press: 50ms
  - Swipe: 30ms

### Touch Target Optimization
- All interactive elements meet 44px minimum size (iOS guidelines)
- Proper spacing between touch targets
- Visual feedback for all touch interactions
- Active states with scale animations

### Performance Optimizations
- Virtualized lists for large card collections
- Lazy loading of card images
- Debounced search and filter operations
- Optimistic UI updates with rollback capability

### Accessibility Features
- Screen reader support for all components
- High contrast mode compatibility
- Keyboard navigation support
- Voice command alternatives for all actions

## ðŸ“± Mobile-First Design Principles

### 1. Progressive Enhancement

- Gesture-based navigation
- Minimal typing requirements
- Voice input alternatives

### 3. Performance Focused
- Fast initial load times
- Smooth 60fps animations
- Efficient memory usage
- Battery-conscious design

### 4. Offline Capability
- Essential features work offline
- Intelligent data caching
- Background synchronization
