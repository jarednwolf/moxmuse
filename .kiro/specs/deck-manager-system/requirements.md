# Deck Manager System Requirements

## Introduction

The current deck system lacks strategic context and evolution tracking. Users need a comprehensive deck management system that persists deck strategies, win conditions, and goals, enabling AI-powered optimization when new sets are released and providing long-term deck development insights.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Strategic Deck Profiles

**User Story:** As a deck builder, I want to define and persist my deck's strategy, win conditions, and goals, so that the AI can provide contextually relevant recommendations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating a deck THEN the system SHALL allow defining strategy type (aggro, control, combo, midrange, etc.)
2. WHEN editing a deck THEN the system SHALL allow specifying primary and secondary win conditions
3. WHEN saving deck strategy THEN the system SHALL persist power level target and budget constraints
4. WHEN viewing deck details THEN the system SHALL display strategy summary and key goals
5. WHEN AI analyzes deck THEN the system SHALL use strategy context for recommendations

### Requirement 2: Deck Evolution Tracking

**User Story:** As a long-term player, I want to track how my decks evolve over time, so that I can understand what changes worked and revert if needed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN modifying a deck THEN the system SHALL create automatic snapshots of significant changes
2. WHEN viewing deck history THEN the system SHALL show chronological list of versions with change summaries
3. WHEN comparing versions THEN the system SHALL highlight added, removed, and modified cards
4. WHEN reverting changes THEN the system SHALL allow restoring to any previous version
5. WHEN tracking performance THEN the system SHALL allow notes on how changes affected gameplay

### Requirement 3: Set Release Integration

**User Story:** As an active player, I want to be notified when new cards might fit my existing decks, so that I can keep my decks optimized with the latest releases.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN new sets are released THEN the system SHALL analyze new cards against existing deck strategies
2. WHEN potential upgrades exist THEN the system SHALL notify users of relevant new cards for their decks
3. WHEN reviewing suggestions THEN the system SHALL explain why new cards fit the deck strategy
4. WHEN accepting suggestions THEN the system SHALL allow easy integration into deck with AI reasoning
5. WHEN dismissing suggestions THEN the system SHALL remember preferences to avoid repeated suggestions

### Requirement 4: Advanced Deck Analytics

**User Story:** As a competitive player, I want detailed analytics about my deck composition and performance, so that I can make data-driven improvements.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing deck analytics THEN the system SHALL display mana curve, color distribution, and type breakdown
2. WHEN analyzing synergies THEN the system SHALL identify card interaction patterns and combo pieces
3. WHEN reviewing performance THEN the system SHALL track win rates and common failure points
4. WHEN comparing to meta THEN the system SHALL show how deck compares to popular strategies
5. WHEN optimizing THEN the system SHALL suggest statistical improvements based on successful similar decks

### Requirement 5: AI-Powered Deck Consultation

**User Story:** As a deck builder, I want ongoing AI consultation about my deck development, so that I can make informed decisions about changes and improvements.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN starting consultation THEN the system SHALL load full deck context including strategy and history
2. WHEN asking questions THEN the AI SHALL provide answers based on current deck state and goals
3. WHEN suggesting changes THEN the AI SHALL explain how changes align with deck strategy
4. WHEN evaluating cards THEN the AI SHALL consider deck's power level and budget constraints
5. WHEN making recommendations THEN the AI SHALL prioritize owned cards when specified

### Requirement 6: Deck Sharing and Collaboration

**User Story:** As a community member, I want to share my deck strategies and learn from others, so that I can improve my deck building skills.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN sharing a deck THEN the system SHALL include strategy description and win condition explanations
2. WHEN viewing shared decks THEN the system SHALL display deck philosophy and key card choices
3. WHEN forking a deck THEN the system SHALL preserve original strategy context while allowing modifications
4. WHEN commenting on decks THEN the system SHALL allow strategic discussions and suggestions
5. WHEN rating decks THEN the system SHALL consider strategy execution and innovation

### Requirement 7: Multi-Format Support

**User Story:** As a player of multiple formats, I want to manage decks across different formats with format-specific features, so that I can optimize for each format's unique requirements.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating decks THEN the system SHALL support Commander, Standard, Modern, Legacy, and other formats
2. WHEN validating decks THEN the system SHALL enforce format-specific rules and restrictions
3. WHEN suggesting cards THEN the system SHALL filter by format legality
4. WHEN analyzing meta THEN the system SHALL provide format-specific insights and trends
5. WHEN tracking performance THEN the system SHALL separate statistics by format

### Requirement 8: Budget and Collection Integration

**User Story:** As a budget-conscious player, I want deck suggestions that respect my financial constraints and prioritize cards I already own, so that I can build competitive decks affordably.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN setting budget THEN the system SHALL track current deck value and remaining budget
2. WHEN suggesting upgrades THEN the system SHALL prioritize owned cards and budget-friendly alternatives
3. WHEN planning purchases THEN the system SHALL provide purchase priority lists with price tracking
4. WHEN collection changes THEN the system SHALL automatically update deck building options
5. WHEN comparing options THEN the system SHALL show cost-benefit analysis for potential changes
