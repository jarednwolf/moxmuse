# Enhanced Collection Browser Requirements

## Introduction

The current LotusList collection browser has poor usability with cards displayed in a basic grid without proper filtering, search, or deck building integration. Users need an intuitive way to browse their collection, find specific cards, and seamlessly add them to decks while chatting with the AI tutor.
