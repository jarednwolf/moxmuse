# AI Deck Building Tutor Requirements

## Introduction

The AI Deck Building Tutor is a comprehensive system that guides users through the entire deck creation process, from initial concept to a fully built 100-card deck. The system provides multiple entry points based on user needs: full deck building with or without commander selection, and individual card recommendations. The tutor leverages AI to create contextually appropriate decks and provides a sophisticated deck editor for review and refinement.
