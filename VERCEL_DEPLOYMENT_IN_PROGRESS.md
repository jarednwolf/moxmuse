# Vercel Deployment In Progress ðŸš€

## Current Status
The deployment script is running! You need to interact with the terminal now.

## Next Steps:

### 1. Press Enter in Terminal
The script is waiting for you to press Enter to continue.

### 2. Vercel Login
When prompted, you'll need to:
- Login to your Vercel account (if not already logged in)
- It will open a browser for authentication

### 3. Project Setup
You'll be asked several questions:

**Set up and deploy?**
- Answer: `Y` (Yes)

**Which scope?**
- Select your personal account or team

**Link to existing project?**
- Answer: `N` (No - create new)

**What's your project's name?**
- Suggested: `moxmuse`
- Or choose another name if moxmuse is taken

**In which directory is your code located?**
- Press Enter (uses current directory `./`)

**Want to modify build settings?**
- Answer: `N` (No - Vercel will auto-detect)

### 4. Initial Deployment
Vercel will:
- Detect Next.js automatically
- Start building your project
- Deploy it to a temporary URL

### 5. After Initial Deployment
You'll get a URL like:
- `https://moxmuse-[random].vercel.app`

## IMPORTANT: Environment Variables

The initial deployment will likely fail or show errors because environment variables aren't set yet.

### After deployment completes:
1. Go to [vercel.com/dashboard](https://vercel.com/dashboard)
2. Click on your `moxmuse` project
3. Go to **Settings â†’ Environment Variables**
4. Add these variables:

```
DATABASE_URL=[Your Supabase Transaction pooler URL]
DATABASE_DIRECT_URL=[Your Supabase Direct connection URL]
NEXTAUTH_SECRET=[Generate with: openssl rand -base64 32]
NEXTAUTH_URL=https://[your-deployment-url].vercel.app
OPENAI_API_KEY=[Your OpenAI key]

# Optional but recommended:
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=[From Supabase project settings]
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=[From Supabase API settings]
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=[From Supabase API settings]
```

### 6. Redeploy
After adding environment variables:
```bash
vercel --prod
```

## What to Expect
- First deployment: ~3-5 minutes
- The site may show errors until environment variables are added
- Once variables are added and redeployed, everything should work!
