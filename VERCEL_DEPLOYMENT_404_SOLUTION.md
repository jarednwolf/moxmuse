# Vercel Deployment 404 Solution

## Current Status
✅ Build completed successfully
✅ All pages generated
✅ Environment variables loaded (OpenAI key working)
✅ Deployment is READY
❌ Getting 404 errors when accessing the site

## The Issue
The deployment is successful but we're getting 404 errors. This is likely because:

1. **Vercel Project Structure**: Your project is a monorepo, and Vercel deployed from the root
2. **Root Directory**: The Next.js app is in `apps/web`, not the root
3. **Output Directory**: Vercel may be looking for files in the wrong location

## Solution

### Option 1: Configure Root Directory in Vercel Dashboard
1. Go to your Vercel Dashboard
2. Select the "moxmuse" project
3. Go to **Settings** → **General**
4. Find **Root Directory**
5. Set it to: `apps/web`
6. Save changes
7. Trigger a new deployment

### Option 2: Update vercel.json
Your current vercel.json already has the correct settings:
```json
{
  "buildCommand": "cd apps/web && pnpm run build",
  "outputDirectory": "apps/web/.next",
  "installCommand": "pnpm install",
  "framework": "nextjs"
}
```

But you may need to add:
```json
{
  "rootDirectory": "apps/web",
  "buildCommand": "pnpm run build",
  "outputDirectory": ".next",
  "installCommand": "pnpm install",
  "framework": "nextjs"
}
```

### Option 3: Check Build Output
The build logs show successful generation of all routes:
- ✓ / (home page)
- ✓ /tutor
- ✓ /decks
- ✓ /admin/analytics
- ✓ /auth/signin
- etc.

## Immediate Action
Since you have a terminal prompt asking about linking to an existing project:
- Answer **Y** (yes) to link to existing project
- This will connect to your already deployed "moxmuse" project

## After Fixing
Your app will be live at: https://moxmuse.vercel.app

All features will be available:
- Landing page with MTG backgrounds
- Deck building tutor
- AI-powered deck generation
- Collection management
- User authentication
