Date: January 2, 2025
Test: Full Teysa Karlov Deck Generation through UI

## Test Summary

### ✅ Successful Components

1. **Authentication Fixed**
   - Updated NEXTAUTH_SECRET to proper 512-bit key
   - Demo user login working (demo@example.com / password)
   - Session management functioning correctly

2. **Deck Generation Process**
   - Successfully initiated deck generation for Teysa Karlov
   - Unique session ID created: `session_1754154901186_5onq3vn44-deck-1754154937736`
   - Progress tracking UI displayed correctly
   - AI assistant confirmed deck generation
   - Success notification showed: "Deck created successfully! Redirecting..."
   - Automatic redirect to deck view page

3. **API Integration**
   - OpenAI API connection working
   - TRPC endpoints responding correctly
   - Real-time progress updates functioning

### ⚠️ Issues Identified

1. **Card Display Issue**
   - Deck structure created but cards not displaying in UI
   - All categories (Ramp, Land, Draw, etc.) show 0 cards
   - Deck view page loads but card data is missing

2. **Performance**
   - Generation took ~90+ seconds (longer than estimated 30-60 seconds)
   - May need optimization for better response times

## Test Flow Evidence

1. **Login Screen**: Successfully authenticated with demo credentials
2. **AI Tutor Page**: Accessed deck building wizard
3. **Commander Selection**: Entered "Teysa Karlov" and continued
4. **Generation Progress**: Showed real-time progress with steps:
   - Analyzing commander synergies
   - Selecting optimal mana base
   - Adding ramp and card draw
   - Including interaction and removal
   - Finalizing win conditions
5. **Success Message**: AI confirmed 99-card deck generation
6. **Deck View**: Redirected but cards not visible

## Next Steps

1. **Debug Card Storage**
   - Check if cards are being saved to database
   - Verify card data structure matches UI expectations
   - Review deck-to-card relationship in database

2. **Investigate Data Flow**
   - Trace card data from generation to storage to display
   - Check for any data transformation issues
   - Verify TRPC response includes card data

3. **UI Component Review**
   - Ensure deck view component properly queries for cards
   - Check if card loading state is handled correctly
   - Verify category filtering logic

## Conclusion

The deck generation system is **mostly functional** with successful:
- Authentication
- User flow
- AI integration
- Progress tracking
- Deck creation

However, the final step of **displaying the generated cards needs fixing** before declaring full success. The core infrastructure is working, but the card data pipeline requires attention.
