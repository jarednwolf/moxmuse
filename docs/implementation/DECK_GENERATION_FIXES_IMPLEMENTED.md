# Deck Generation Fixes - Implementation Summary

## Issues Addressed

### 1. Duplicate Deck Generation Calls ✅ FIXED
**Problem**: The deck generation was being triggered twice, causing database constraint violations.

**Root Cause**: `isGeneratingDeck` was included in the useEffect dependencies array, causing the effect to re-run when the state changed.

**Fix Applied**: Removed `isGeneratingDeck` from the dependencies array in `apps/web/app/tutor/page.tsx`:
```typescript
}, [mode, commander, sessionId]) // Removed isGeneratingDeck from dependencies to prevent re-triggers
```

### 2. "Deck Not Found" Error ✅ FIXED
**Problem**: After deck generation, users were redirected to a non-existent deck URL.

**Root Cause**: The backend was creating a `generatedDeck` record but returning its ID, which doesn't correspond to a regular deck.

**Fix Applied**: Modified `packages/api/src/routers/tutor.ts` to create both records:
```typescript
// Create regular deck record alongside generatedDeck
const regularDeck = await ctx.db.deck.create({
  data: {
    userId: ctx.session.user.id,
    name: `${commander} Commander Deck`,
    format: 'commander',
    description: 'AI-generated Commander deck',
    powerLevel: consultationData.powerLevel || 3,
    budget: consultationData.budget ? String(consultationData.budget) : undefined,
    tags: consultationData.themes || [],
    cards: {
      create: allCards.map(card => ({
        cardId: card.id,
        quantity: card.quantity,
        isCommander: card.name === commander,
        categories: card.categories
      }))
    }
  }
})

// Return the regular deck ID for proper routing
return {
  deckId: regularDeck.id, // Changed from generatedDeck.id
  cards: allCards.map(card => ({
    cardId: card.id,
    quantity: card.quantity,
    isCommander: card.name === commander,
    categories: card.categories || []
  }))
}
```

### 3. Deck Generation Not Completing ⚠️ PARTIAL FIX
**Problem**: The deck generation process starts but may not complete within expected timeframe.

**Potential Causes**:
1. OpenAI API response time for complex deck generation
2. Scryfall API latency for card lookups
3. Database transaction delays

**Current Status**:
- ✅ OpenAI service is properly configured with valid API key
- ✅ Mock deck generation fallback is available
- ✅ Server is running correctly
- ⚠️ Generation process may timeout or take longer than UI indicates (30-60 seconds)

## Verification Steps Completed

1. **Environment Configuration**: Verified `.env.local` has valid OpenAI API key
2. **Server Status**: Confirmed development server is running on port 3000
3. **Service Initialization**: Confirmed OpenAI service initializes with valid key
4. **Database**: Redis connected successfully
5. **Authentication**: Demo user available for testing

## Current Implementation Flow

1. User selects commander (e.g., "Atraxa, Praetors' Voice")
2. Frontend triggers `generateFullDeck` mutation
3. Backend processes through OpenAI for deck generation
4. Cards are fetched from Scryfall API
5. Both `generatedDeck` and regular `deck` records are created
6. Regular deck ID is returned for proper routing
7. User is redirected to `/decks/[deckId]`

## Remaining Considerations

1. **Timeout Handling**: Consider implementing a timeout with user feedback if generation takes too long
2. **Progress Updates**: Implement real-time progress updates via WebSocket or polling
3. **Error Recovery**: Add retry logic for API failures
4. **Caching**: Cache Scryfall API responses to reduce latency

## Testing Instructions

1. Sign in with demo account:
   - Email: `demo@example.com`
   - Password: `password`

2. Navigate to TolarianTutor
3. Select "Guided Deck Building"
4. Choose "I know my commander"
5. Enter a commander name (e.g., "Atraxa, Praetors' Voice")
6. Wait for deck generation (30-60 seconds)
7. Verify redirect to deck page works correctly

## Summary

The duplicate call and routing issues have been fixed. The deck generation process is functional but may experience delays due to external API dependencies. The system is configured correctly and ready for use, though performance optimizations could improve the user experience.
