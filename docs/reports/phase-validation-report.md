# Invalid credentials test
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/auth/signin \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email":"invalid@test.com","password":"wrong"}'
Result: ✅ 302 Redirect (Expected behavior)

# Protected route access test
curl http://localhost:3000/tutor
Result: ✅ Redirected to sign-in (Middleware working)
