# Deck Generation Complete Status Report

## ‚úÖ What's Working

1. **Authentication System**
   - Demo user exists and can log in via UI
   - NEXTAUTH_SECRET is properly configured

2. **Deck Generation Backend**
   - AI deck generation completes successfully
   - 99 cards are properly saved to the database
   - Cards have proper categories and quantities
   - Both GeneratedDeck and regular Deck records are created

3. **Database Structure**
   - DeckCard records exist with proper relationships
   - Card IDs are valid Scryfall IDs
   - Database queries work correctly

## ‚ùå Issues Found

1. **Authentication for API Calls**
   - Cookie-based authentication failing for TRPC endpoints
   - getCardDetails endpoint returns UNAUTHORIZED even with cookies

2. **Card Display in UI**
   - Deck view shows 0 cards despite 99 being in database
   - Cards need Scryfall data to display (images, names, prices)
   - getCardDetails endpoint is not accessible due to auth issues

## üîß Root Cause

The deck generation is fully functional, but the UI can't display cards because:
1. The collection.getCardDetails TRPC endpoint requires authentication
2. The authentication cookies aren't being properly passed/validated
3. Without card details from Scryfall, the UI has no card names/images to display

## üöÄ Solution

To make the deck display work, we need to either:
1. Fix the authentication issue for the getCardDetails endpoint
2. Make the getCardDetails endpoint public for reading card data
3. Pre-fetch and store Scryfall data during deck generation

The simplest immediate fix would be to make getCardDetails a public procedure since it's just reading public card data from Scryfall.
