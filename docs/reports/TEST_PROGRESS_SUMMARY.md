### ❌ Failing Tests (2/12)

2. **Deck Building Tutor Journey** - Missing UI elements in wizard flow

### ⏭️ Skipped Tests (2)
1. **Generate and Save Deck** - Requires working authentication
2. **View and Edit Saved Decks** - Requires working authentication

## Key Issues Identified

### 1. Authentication State Inconsistency
- Auth.json is created successfully with valid tokens
- Some tests recognize the authenticated state, others don't
- Likely a timing issue or race condition

### 2. Deck Building Wizard Flow
- Wizard steps may appear in different order
- Some steps might be skipped based on previous selections
- Need more flexible test approach

### 3. Microsoft Edge Not Installed
- 14 tests fail due to missing Edge browser
- Can be fixed by running: `npx playwright install msedge`
- Or remove Edge from test configuration

## Progress Since Last Report

### Fixed ✓
- Strict mode violations in selectors
- Authentication test logic (now checking for correct elements)
- User Decks Page test (now passing)
- Multiple UI element selectors updated

### Still Need Fixing
- Authentication state consistency
- Deck building wizard flow flexibility
- Missing UI error messages for error states

## Recommendations

1. **For Authentication Issues**:
   - Add retry logic for auth state verification
   - Consider using a more reliable selector for auth state
   - Add explicit wait for auth state to propagate

2. **For Deck Building Wizard**:
   - Make wizard steps more flexible
   - Don't assume strict order of steps
   - Add fallback logic for skipped steps

3. **For Overall Test Stability**:
   - Add more explicit waits where needed
   - Use data-testid attributes for critical elements
   - Consider running tests sequentially instead of in parallel

## Next Steps

1. Fix authentication state recognition (Priority 1)
2. Update deck building wizard test for flexibility (Priority 2)
3. Run full test suite across all browsers once fixes are complete
4. Update remaining tests in other test files
