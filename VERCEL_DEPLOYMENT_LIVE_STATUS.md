### 2. Check the Preview URL
Once built, visit: https://moxmuse-e2xs4xlq8-jareds-projects-247fc15d.vercel.app

**Note:** The site will likely show errors because environment variables aren't set yet!

### 3. Add Environment Variables
Go to: https://vercel.com/jareds-projects-247fc15d/moxmuse/settings/environment-variables

Add these critical variables:
```
DATABASE_URL=[Your Supabase pooler URL]
DATABASE_DIRECT_URL=[Your Supabase direct URL]
NEXTAUTH_SECRET=[Generate with: openssl rand -base64 32]
NEXTAUTH_URL=https://moxmuse-e2xs4xlq8-jareds-projects-247fc15d.vercel.app
OPENAI_API_KEY=[Your OpenAI key]
```

### 4. Redeploy for Production
After adding environment variables:
```bash
vercel --prod
```

This will create your production deployment at a cleaner URL.
