# Vercel Deployment Authentication Fix

## Issue
Your deployment is returning a 401 Unauthorized error because Vercel Authentication is enabled on your project.

## Solution

### Option 1: Disable Vercel Authentication (Recommended for Public Sites)

1. Go to your Vercel Dashboard
2. Select your project (moxmuse)
3. Go to **Settings** → **General**
4. Scroll down to **Vercel Authentication**
5. Toggle it **OFF**
6. Save the changes

### Option 2: Keep Authentication but Add Public Access

1. Go to your Vercel Dashboard
2. Select your project
3. Go to **Settings** → **Deployment Protection**
4. Under "Protection Bypass for Automation", add your domain
5. Or set specific paths to be public

### Option 3: Use Environment Variables to Control Access

The deployment is working correctly - it's just behind authentication. Once you disable Vercel Authentication, your site will be publicly accessible.

## Current Status

✅ Deployment successful
✅ Environment variables loaded (OpenAI key detected in logs)
✅ Domain alias configured (moxmuse.vercel.app)
❌ Vercel Authentication blocking public access

## After Disabling Authentication

Your app will be live at: https://moxmuse.vercel.app

Features:
- Beautiful landing page with cycling MTG backgrounds
- User authentication with NextAuth
- AI-powered deck generation
- Collection management
- All deck building features
