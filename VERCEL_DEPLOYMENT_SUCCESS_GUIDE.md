# ðŸŽ‰ Vercel Deployment Success - Final Configuration

## Your app deployed successfully! 

The 404 error you're seeing is because environment variables need to be configured in Vercel.

## Required Environment Variables

Go to your Vercel project â†’ Settings â†’ Environment Variables and add:

### 1. Authentication (Required)
```
NEXTAUTH_URL=https://moxmuse.vercel.app
NEXTAUTH_SECRET=your-generated-secret-here
```

To generate NEXTAUTH_SECRET:
```bash
openssl rand -base64 32
```

### 2. Database (Required)
```
DATABASE_URL=your-supabase-connection-string
SUPABASE_URL=your-supabase-project-url
SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-supabase-anon-key
```

### 3. OpenAI (Required for AI features)
```
OPENAI_API_KEY=your-openai-api-key
```

### 4. Optional but Recommended
```
SCRYFALL_API_KEY=your-scryfall-key
MOXFIELD_CLIENT_ID=your-moxfield-client-id
MOXFIELD_CLIENT_SECRET=your-moxfield-client-secret
```

## Important Settings

1. **Enable for all environments**: Check "Production", "Preview", and "Development"
2. **Redeploy after adding**: Click "Redeploy" in Vercel dashboard

## Quick Test URLs

After setting environment variables and redeploying:

1. Homepage: https://moxmuse.vercel.app
2. Sign in: https://moxmuse.vercel.app/auth/signin
3. Tutor: https://moxmuse.vercel.app/tutor
4. Decks: https://moxmuse.vercel.app/decks

## Troubleshooting

If still showing 404 after environment variables:

1. **Check Function Logs**:
   - Vercel Dashboard â†’ Functions â†’ View logs
   - Look for any runtime errors

2. **Verify NEXTAUTH_URL**:
   - Must match your Vercel URL exactly
   - Include https:// but no trailing slash

3. **Database Connection**:
   - Ensure DATABASE_URL is correct
   - Check Supabase allows connections from Vercel

4. **Clear Cache**:
   ```bash
   vercel --force
   ```

## Common Issues

### "NEXTAUTH_URL is not defined"
- Add NEXTAUTH_URL to Vercel environment variables
- Set it to your full Vercel URL (https://moxmuse.vercel.app)

### "Cannot connect to database"
- Verify DATABASE_URL format
- Check Supabase connection pooling settings
- Ensure SSL is enabled in connection string

### "SessionProvider is not defined"
- This means NextAuth isn't configured properly
- Double-check NEXTAUTH_SECRET is set

## Success Indicators

Once properly configured, you should see:
- Homepage with cycling MTG land backgrounds
- "Get Started Free" button
- Navigation header with logo
- Four feature cards (SolSync, LotusList, TolarianTutor, DeckForge)

## Next Steps

1. Set all required environment variables
2. Redeploy from Vercel dashboard
3. Test the homepage loads
4. Try signing in with demo account:
   - Email: demo@moxmuse.com
   - Password: demo123

Congratulations on getting this far! ðŸš€
